Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock. (:

I'll just desribes some things about this project for starters the computer pickes a number between 0-2 and that translate to rock,paper or scissors.
then YOU the player picks between rock, paper or scissors. it's a very simple if else statement and simple counter just look at the code to understand.

as for the CSS It's just transition effects when hover over the icons... and 
if your wonder how'd I made that loop of rock,paper,scissors,shoot thing on the opposite side of the vs it's just a animtion. I actully was planning on making a fade, but it
looked janki so I threw that idea out. anyways that's the idea behind this project. (it's a school project btw)

PS: this is my first readme file so I don't know if I'm doing it right. anyways thanks for reading!
