Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock. (:

I'll just describes some things about this project for starters the computer picks a number between 0-2 and that translate to rock, paper or scissors. then YOU the player picks between rock, paper or scissors. it's a very simple if else statement and simple counter just look at the code to understand.

as for the CSS It's just transition effects when hover over the icons... and if your wonder how'd I made that loop of rock, paper, scissors and shoot thing on the opposite side of the VS it's just a animation.
